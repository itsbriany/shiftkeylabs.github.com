# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Challenge

Last week, I participated in the [Microsoft Machine Learning Challenge](http://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience/news-events/events/2016/03/21/microsoft_machine_learning_challenge_with_susan_ibach.html). I went to this event because I thought it would be a great opportunity to not only learn about machine learning, but to get some insight into how life is at a huge tech company.

In this machine learning challenge, we needed to develop a machine learning model that would predict with at least 80% accuracy that a flight would land on time given a specific data set (i.e. one of the ones provided by Microsoft Azure). The challenge was overall a great experience for me. Here are the highlights:

- You must be familiar with the dataset you are analyzing. By this, I mean you want to pick the columns that are most important to a machine learning model.
- It can sometimes take a long time for a machine learning model to produce results
- To predict boolean data, a **two-class** algorithm must be used
- The best algorithm for this challenge was the **boosted decision treee regression algorithm**
- Machine learning is a very powerful tool. Microsoft is working on [Project Oxford](https://www.projectoxford.ai/) in order to detect faces, emotions, motion in videos, convert speech-to-text and text-to-speech, etc... This looks like a great toolkit for a hackathon!
- People are always working on new and innovative technologies at Microsoft. The evangelist mentioned that you will never be bored there and you will likely get distracted!
